# Council Chat Environment Variables

# No environment variables are required for basic usage!
# Council Chat uses:
# - Local SQLite database (created automatically with `npm run db:push`)
# - OpenRouter API key stored in your browser (entered via Settings page)

# Just run:
#   npm install
#   npm run db:push
#   npm run dev
# Then open http://localhost:3000 and enter your OpenRouter API key in Settings.
