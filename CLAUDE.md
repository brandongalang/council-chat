### Morph Warp Grep — AI-powered code search

**Use `mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep` for exploratory "how does X work?" questions.** An AI search agent automatically expands your query into multiple search patterns, greps the codebase, reads relevant files, and returns precise line ranges with full context—all in one call.

**Use `ripgrep` (via Grep tool) for targeted searches.** When you know exactly what you're looking for—a specific function name, error message, or config key—ripgrep is faster and more direct.

**Use `ast-grep` for structural code patterns.** When you need to match/rewrite AST nodes while ignoring comments/strings, or enforce codebase-wide rules.

**When to use what**
| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| "How is authentication implemented?" | `warp_grep` | Exploratory; don't know where to start |
| "Where is the L3 Guardian appeals system?" | `warp_grep` | Need to understand architecture, find multiple related files |
| "Find all uses of `useQuery(`" | `ripgrep` | Targeted literal search |
| "Find files with `console.log`" | `ripgrep` | Simple pattern, known target |
| "Rename `getUserById` → `fetchUser`" | `ast-grep` | Structural refactor, avoid comments/strings |
| "Replace all `var` with `let`" | `ast-grep` | Codemod across codebase |

**warp_grep strengths**
* **Reduces context pollution**: Returns only relevant line ranges, not entire files.
* **Intelligent expansion**: Turns "appeals system" into searches for `appeal`, `Appeals`, `guardian`, `L3`, etc.
* **One-shot answers**: Finds the 3-5 most relevant files with precise locations vs. manual grep→read cycles.
* **Natural language**: Works well with "how", "where", "what" questions.

**warp_grep usage**
```
mcp__filesystem-with-morph__warpgrep_codebase_search(
repoPath: "/data/projects/communitai",
query: "How is the L3 Guardian appeals system implemented?"
)
```
Returns structured results with file paths, line ranges, and extracted code snippets.

**Rule of thumb**
* **Don't know where to look** → `warp_grep` (let AI find it)
* **Know the pattern** → `ripgrep` (fastest)
* **Need AST precision** → `ast-grep` (safest for rewrites)

**Anti-patterns**
* ❌ Using `warp_grep` to find a specific function name you already know → use `ripgrep`
* ❌ Using `ripgrep` to understand "how does X work" → wastes time with manual file reads
* ❌ Using `ripgrep` for codemods → misses comments/strings, risks collateral edits
